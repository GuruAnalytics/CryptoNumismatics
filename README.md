# CryptoNumismatics

**CryptoNumismatics** is the scientific study and/or collection of Cryptocurrencies and Cryptotokens. I am not even sure whether the term is defined already, but being a Numismatist for the past 18 years and currently working in Cryptocurreny & Blockchain Technology, I always thought this. Recently started collecting (trading), so thought to share through github. 

This can be very well considered as the branch of **Numismatics**.
